            </h2>
            <p>
              While Kanha Sarthi Foundation makes every effort to execute relief distributions (e.g. food packets, study kits, plant saplings) in exact accordance with listed campaign details across Bihar, Jharkhand, Delhi NCR, and Uttar Pradesh, unexpected field conditions—such as severe weather, emergency administrative curfews, or local supply availability—may require minor operational adaptations. In all such cases, resources are redirected to serve beneficiary groups of equivalent need in neighboring regional areas.
